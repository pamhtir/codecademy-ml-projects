# My Codecademy ML Projects



This repository showcases a collection of projects I completed after finishing the Codecademy Career Path: Data Scientist: Machine Learning. These projects demonstrate my skills in data analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning using Python and popular libraries such as pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and Matplotlib. Each project focuses on solving real-world problems, applying machine learning algorithms, and interpreting results to gain actionable insights.
Feel free to explore the code and project documentation to see my approach to data-driven problem solving!
